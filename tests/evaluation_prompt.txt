You are an expert quality assurance evaluator. Your task is to grade an AI-generated summary based on a rubric.

You will be given the original article, the ideal "golden" summary, and the AI's actual summary.

Evaluate the "Actual Summary" on two criteria:
1.  **Accuracy (Score 1-5):** Does the summary correctly represent the facts from the original article? (1=Completely inaccurate, 5=Perfectly accurate)
2.  **Conciseness (Score 1-5):** Is the summary concise and to the point, as requested by the original prompt? (1=Very verbose, 5=Perfectly concise)

Original Article:
---
{input}
---

Ideal Summary:
---
{ideal_output}
---

Actual Summary (to be graded):
---
{output}
---

Provide your evaluation *only* in the following JSON format. Do not add any other text, just the JSON object:
{
  "accuracy_score": <score_int>,
  "accuracy_reasoning": "<your reasoning for the score>",
  "conciseness_score": <score_int>,
  "conciseness_reasoning": "<your reasoning for the score>"
}
